## ‚ö° Quick Start (3 minutes)

**Goal:** See how chaining prompts enables complex workflows.

**Sequential Workflow Example:**

```bash
claude
```

**Prompt 1 - Design:**
```
> Design a transaction deduplication function

Return: Function signature and high-level approach only
```

**Prompt 2 - Implement (after reviewing design):**
```
> Implement the deduplication function using the design we just discussed

Use PySpark window functions
Return: Complete working code
```

**Prompt 3 - Test:**
```
> Generate pytest tests for the deduplication function we just implemented

Include: happy path, duplicates, edge cases
```

**Prompt 4 - Document:**
```
> Create documentation for the deduplication feature

Include: usage examples, performance notes, integration guide
```

**Exit Claude:**
```bash
Ctrl+D
```

## What is Prompt Chaining?

### Definition

**Prompt chaining** = Breaking a complex task into a sequence of smaller prompts, where each builds on previous results.

**Why chain prompts?**
- ‚úÖ Review intermediate results before proceeding
- ‚úÖ Adjust course if early steps reveal issues
- ‚úÖ Keep each prompt focused and clear
- ‚úÖ Easier to debug if something goes wrong
- ‚úÖ Natural workflow matches development process

### Chaining vs. Single Complex Prompt

**Single Complex Prompt (All-in-one):**
```
> Design, implement, test, and document a transaction validator
```

**Problems:**
- If design is wrong, whole implementation is wrong
- Can't review before implementation
- Hard to iterate

**Chained Prompts (Step-by-step):**
```
Prompt 1: > Design transaction validator (review design)
Prompt 2: > Implement based on approved design
Prompt 3: > Generate tests
Prompt 4: > Add documentation
```

**Benefits:**
- Review and approve design before coding
- Adjust implementation based on early results
- Each step is manageable
- Easy to go back and refine

## Common Chaining Patterns

### Pattern 1: Design ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Document

**The Classic Development Workflow:**

**Step 1: Design**
```
> Design a currency conversion function for transaction enrichment

Requirements:
- Support USD, EUR, GBP conversion
- Use exchange rate table
- Handle missing exchange rates gracefully

Return only:
- Function signature
- High-level algorithm
- Data structures needed
```

**Step 2: Implement (after approving design)**
```
> Implement the currency conversion function using this design:
[paste approved design]

Requirements:
- PySpark DataFrame operations
- Type hints
- Error handling
```

**Step 3: Test**
```
> Generate pytest tests for the currency_converter function

Test cases:
- Valid conversion (USD ‚Üí EUR)
- Missing exchange rate (fallback)
- Invalid currency code
- Large batch conversion
```

**Step 4: Document**
```
> Create module documentation for currency_converter.py

Include:
- Function documentation (docstrings)
- Usage examples
- Performance notes
- Integration guide
```

---

### Pattern 2: Analyze ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Verify

**The Debugging Workflow:**

**Step 1: Analyze**
```
> Analyze why the aggregation pipeline is running slow

<code>
[paste slow code]
</code>

<symptoms>
- Takes 45 minutes for 10M records
- Target: < 15 minutes
</symptoms>

Return:
- Top 3 performance bottlenecks
- Evidence from code
```

**Step 2: Fix (after understanding bottlenecks)**
```
> Fix the performance bottlenecks we identified:
1. Unnecessary shuffle in join
2. Missing partition pruning
3. Too many output partitions

Apply fixes and explain changes
```

**Step 3: Verify**
```
> Generate performance test to verify optimization

Test should:
- Measure execution time before/after
- Validate output matches original
- Check resource utilization
```

---

### Pattern 3: Research ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implement

**The Discovery Workflow:**

**Step 1: Research**
```
> Search the codebase for existing validation patterns

Find:
- What validation functions already exist?
- What libraries/utilities are being used?
- What patterns should we follow?
```

**Step 2: Design (using research findings)**
```
> Design a new merchant_id validation function

Follow the patterns we found in:
- pipelines/validators/account_validator.py
- pipelines/validators/currency_validator.py

New requirements:
- Pattern: MERCH[A-Z0-9]{8}
- Not null validation
- Integration with existing validator framework
```

**Step 3: Implement**
```
> Implement merchant_id validator matching the approved design

Ensure it integrates with the existing validator pipeline
```

## Banking Data Engineering Workflows

### Workflow 1: Feature Development End-to-End

**Scenario:** Add merchant category enrichment to transaction pipeline

**Prompt Chain:**

**1. Requirements Analysis**
```
> Analyze requirements for adding merchant_category to transactions

Current state:
- transactions table has merchant_id
- merchant_dim table has merchant_id, merchant_category

Requirements:
- Enrich transactions with merchant_category via join
- Handle missing merchants (leave category as NULL)
- Optimize for performance (merchant_dim is 100MB)

Return:
- Join strategy recommendation
- Performance impact estimate
- Risks and mitigation
```

**2. Schema Design**
```
> Design schema change for merchant_category field

Based on analysis:
[paste analysis from step 1]

Provide:
- Updated StructType for transactions table
- Migration script approach (Delta Lake)
- Backward compatibility plan
```

**3. Implementation**
```
> Implement the enrichment logic

Using the schema design:
[paste schema from step 2]

Requirements:
- Use broadcast join (merchant_dim < 100MB)
- Add to existing transaction_enricher.py
- Preserve existing enrichment logic
```

**4. Testing**
```
> Generate integration tests for merchant enrichment

Test scenarios:
- Transaction with valid merchant_id
- Transaction with missing merchant_id (NULL category)
- Batch of 1000 transactions (performance test)
- Merchant_dim table missing (error handling)
```

**5. Documentation & Deployment**
```
> Create deployment plan and documentation

Include:
- Step-by-step deployment procedure
- Rollback plan
- Monitoring queries to verify enrichment is working
- FAQ for team members
```

<code>
[paste pipeline code]
</code>

Analyze:
- Which stage takes most time?
- What Spark operations are used?
- Any shuffle operations?
- Partition count at each stage?

Return execution plan analysis
```

**2. Root Cause**
```
> Based on profiling results, identify root cause of slowness

Profiling showed:
[paste profiling results]

Determine:
- Is this a shuffle problem?
- Data skew issue?
- Memory problem?
- Wrong algorithm choice?

Provide specific evidence
```

**3. Solution Design**
```
> Design optimization strategy for the identified root cause

Root cause:
[paste root cause from step 2]

Propose:
- Specific code changes
- Configuration tuning
- Alternative algorithms if needed

Estimate performance improvement
```

**4. Implementation**
```
> Implement the optimization

Apply the design:
[paste design from step 3]

Provide:
- Updated code with changes highlighted
- Configuration changes
- Before/after comparison
```

**5. Benchmarking**
```
> Create benchmark to measure optimization impact

Benchmark should:
- Run both old and new code
- Measure execution time
- Compare output correctness
- Track memory usage
```

**Prompt Chain:**

**1. Audit Scope**
```
> Define PCI-DSS audit scope for payment processing pipeline

Identify:
- Which pipelines handle cardholder data?
- What PCI-DSS requirements apply?
- What evidence is needed?

List all files/components in scope
```

**2. Compliance Check**
```
> Audit pipelines for PCI-DSS compliance

Files in scope:
[paste scope from step 1]

Check each requirement:
- 3.2: CVV not stored post-authorization
- 3.4: PAN masked in logs
- 6.5.1: No SQL injection
- 10.2: Audit trail present

Provide evidence or gaps for each
```

**3. Remediation Plan**
```
> Create remediation plan for compliance gaps

Gaps found:
[paste gaps from step 2]

For each gap:
- Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Remediation action
- Estimated effort
- Implementation approach
```

**4. Implementation**
```
> Implement highest priority remediation

Gap: [paste #1 gap]

Provide:
- Code fix
- Testing approach
- Verification method
```

**5. Evidence Collection**
```
